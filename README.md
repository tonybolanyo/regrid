# re/grid

Using a ready-to-use framework ready to manage the style of your web is (usually) fast and easy, but not every project needs the full features, nor big files to import.

As a personal exercise, I want to create a grid system for responsive web desing following these rules:

- it must use a precompiler. I choose SASS
- **only** can handle grid system. No other styles to worry. Maybe some kind of reset.
- it must allow easily integration in other future SASS projects.
- please, please, please, try to minimize its size and choose simple names for classes.
